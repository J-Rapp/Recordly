# Recordly

Well hello! App creation started around 4:20pm Pacific, here we go :)

Okie doke, roughly 1 hour in and dev/prod are both set up. Time to work on tests and features.

## 2 hour mark

I left off working on my feature/registration branch. I started creating a simple AJAX call to render the form for user#new. Once that was built, I was going to start with mthe User model and migration, using Bcrypt for authentication.

## Reflection

I definitely didn't make it as far as I'd liked thanks to some snags with Postgres on both my dev and prod environments, but I'm proud that I didn't let the bugs get me too stressed. Sure it hindered my overall progress, but addressing bugs like those can be equally as important productive/learning moments.

I was perhaps too rushed pressing forward in attempt to get to the user model, when I could've started TDD.

I was relying heavily on the master branch, whereas separate 'develop' and 'deploy' branches would've been more appropriate.
